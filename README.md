# Chess Robot
A robotic chess system that combines computer vision and robotic control to play physical chess games autonomously.

## Overview
This project implements a robotic arm that can identify chess pieces and their positions using computer vision, then physically move pieces using precise servo control and inverse kinematics.

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** - Active development with core systems under construction

## Core Components
### Hardware
- 20-inch articulated robotic arm (3D printed)
- Raspberry Pi 4B
- Raspberry Pi AI Camera 
- PCA9685 PWM driver
- High-torque 270Â° metal gear servos (40KG-60KG)

### Software 
- Computer vision system using OpenCV for board detection
- PyTorch neural network for piece classification
- Inverse kinematics for precise arm movement
- CAD models created in Autodesk Fusion 360

## Planned Features
- [ ] Complete board detection system
- [ ] Piece classification model
- [ ] Inverse kinematics implementation
- [ ] Full game loop automation

## Development Timeline
- November 2024: Project start, initial design & CAD
- January 2025: Computer vision development
